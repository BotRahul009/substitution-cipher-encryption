Substitution Cipher Encryption
This Python script demonstrates a simple substitution cipher encryption technique. Substitution ciphers replace each letter in the plaintext with another letter according to a key.

How it Works
The script takes a plaintext message and a key as input. The key is a mapping of each letter of the alphabet to its corresponding substitute letter. 
For example, 'a' might be substituted with 'q', 'b' with 'w', and so on. The script then encrypts the plaintext message using this key and outputs the encrypted message.
